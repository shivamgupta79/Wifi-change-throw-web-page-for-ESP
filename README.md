This project is work for ESP Board.

The code sets up an ESP32 device to manage WiFi connections via a web interface. It can save, retrieve, and remove WiFi credentials, and switch between Station and Access Point modes based on connection status.

#Not need to change wifi to code direct change to the web page.
